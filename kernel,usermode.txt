user mode means user can use some application to get access to something
but all major accessability is present in kernel mode
but the processor switches between both modes
 
example we open text editor and write a code in it 
this file will be saved in HDD OR SDD which is a hardware component of our system
which is under control of our kernel so we cant direcrlt access it 

(kernel mode is 0 bit and user mode is 1 bit)
when we run a program it first does user process executing then it gets system
call (different types of them exist) then it goes to kernel mode to access 
what it requires ,here sy stem call is executed ,then system call is returned 
to system call to give the output to the user

but kernel access is only for certain program where we need to access some
sort of resource under kernel like to print something on screen
 
but to do simple calculations like 2+2 kernel is not needed
