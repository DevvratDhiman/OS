fork is used to create a child process of the parent process 
child process is usually made when parent process is busy and the child process is duplicate of parent but has different id registers and everything else is new 

OR WE CAN USE THREADS IN WHICH WE DONT MAKE CLONES,EVERYTHING IS SHARED UNLIKE fork,ONLY A FEW NEW THINGS ARE NEW 

fork returns +1 and 0 ,0 means child and +1 means parent 
-1 is for when child process couldnt be made for some reason 


fork processes are made in 2^n where 
1 is parent and child processes are 2^n-1



CHILD PROCESS ID RETURNS 0 WHEN FORK IS DONE AND PARENT RETURNS +1
